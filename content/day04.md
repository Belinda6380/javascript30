* all the array functions like {{< code "filter" >}}, {{< code "sort" >}} etc
* {{< code "console.table()" >}} function

* {{< code ".map()" >}} will always return the same number of array items that it takes in
* template strings

This was a very light introduction to array methods and I don't think I fully grasp them yet.
