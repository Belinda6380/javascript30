* returning a function within itself can help perform a check on its output, and is a form of recursion
* {{< code "setTimeout()" >}} method to do something after a certain amount of time
* how to usefully calculate random numbers
* that you can use the {{< code "isTrusted" >}} property on a mouse event to check if the click truly came from the user's device (as opposed to Javascript)
