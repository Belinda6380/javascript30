* Returning a function within itself can help perform a check on its output, and is a form of recursion
* {{< code "setTimeout()" >}} method to do something after a certain amount of time
* How to usefully calculate random numbers
* That you can use the {{< code "isTrusted" >}} property on a mouse event to check if the click truly came from the user's device (as opposed to Javascript)

It seems simpler to build a whack-a-mole game than I was expecting! I'd love to try making another tiny game from scratch sometime.
