* speech synthesis API is available in most browsers
* using {{< code "find()" >}} to loop through an array and match a value to a property
* various methods available to speak, stop speaking and change voices
* setting a flag as a default for a method's parameter, but this can't be passed with the flag to an event listener - you have to pass a function

I added some code to change the default language and filter to fewer languages.
