* the concept of 'bubbling' - triggering events on all parent elements in the document
* 'capturing' goes top-down; 'bubbling' goes back up
* passing a third argument in a event listener is an 'options' object and you can set if you want it to fire on the capturing
* {{< code "stopPropagation()" >}} method will stop the bubbling up
* the 'once' option - which unbinds the event listener

Not much in the actual demo for this one but the concepts are very useful.
