* {{< code "sort()" >}} method on arrays and how to pass a function with two options to compare
* regex for stripping "a", "the" or "an" and how to make it insensitive
* setting an array to {{< code "innerHTML" >}} will call {{< code "toString()" >}} and put a comma between each item - so using {{< code "join('')" >}} will remove the commas

I kept my version of the code without ES6 as much as possible for readability (until I can better grasp ternerary operators, arrow functions and implicit returns at a glance without my brain exploding).
