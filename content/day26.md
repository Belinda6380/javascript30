* That you can use a full CSS selector in {{< code "querySelector()" >}} methods (with child or sibling selectors)
* {{< code "mouseEnter" >}} and {{< code "mouseLeave" >}} events
* In ES6 arrow functions, the value of {{< code "this" >}} is inherited from any parent functions
* {{< code "getBoundingClientRect()" >}} is used to get the bounding box of an element, but you need to account for extra elements above the content you want to place - which is taken care of in jQuery with {{< code "offset()" >}} for you
* {{< code ".style.setProperty(x,y)" >}} works by taking in the property as x and the thing you're setting it to as y
* You can't tell the width and the height of a hidden element
* {{< code "classList.contains()" >}} checks if an element has a class
* The second portion of a statement evaluating using {{< code "&&" >}} won't run if the first doesn't evaluate to true (I think I already knew this on some level, but this was a great reminder!)
* {{< code "perspective" >}} CSS property

This was a good recap on ES6 template strings and setting styles with Javascript, as well as a really nice animation effect based on a menu on [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)'s website.
