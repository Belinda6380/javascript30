* {{< code "scroll" >}} event listener
* Performance issues with detecting scroll & the need for debouncing
* That you can set default function argument values as initial arguments (I think I already knew this but definitely a great refresher/example)
* {{< code "window.scrollY" >}} and {{< code "offsetTop" >}} properties
* How to access the height and width of DOM elements 

It was really helpful to learn how the different properties of the images and the window can be used to calculate positions and heights. This felt like a real-life example of on-page animation that will be good to return to.
