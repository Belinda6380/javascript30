# Javascript30

Demo site and learnings from the 30 Javascript exercises in the [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com) course from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com). No compilers, no frameworks, no libraries - just vanilla Javascript. I've refactored and updated the CSS for consistent styling.

This demo site is held together by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and all the beautiful street photography is by [Steve Roe](https://unsplash.com/@steveroe_).
